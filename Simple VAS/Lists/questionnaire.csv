I had the impression to look at myself in a mirror.
It seemed my  movement were caused by the movement of dog's face. 
It seemed as I was in control of the dog's face movement.
It seemed as if I might have more than one face. 
It seemed as if the  dog's face began to resemble my own face in terms of shape or skin tone or some other visual feature.
It seemed as if my face was turning into a dog's face.
I had the impression that if I had moved my eyes the eyes of the dog in the video would have moved too.
